function [ cv_struct ] = cvpartition_trialwise( trial_numbers, desired_nCV )
% This mimics the functionality of Matlab's cvpartition() which divides
% data into (stratified) CV folds, but ""_trialwise does not split trials into different
% CV folds. This is important for fitting time series because data points
% within a trial are "less indpendent" than data points across trials.
% Thus, one should not train on some data points from a given trial and
% test on the remaining data points from that same trial. 
% This function attempts to create CV folds of the same size without
% splitting trials. This may mean that the CV folds are not exactly the
% same size.
%
% Properties needed:
%   N:              Number of observations
%   NumTestSets:    Number of test sets
%   TestSize:       Size of each test set
%   TrainSize:      Size of each training set
%   Type:           Type of partition
%
% Methods needed: (need to do this?)
%   disp:           Diisplay cvpartition obect
%   display:        Display cvpartition object
%   repartition:    Repartition data for cross-validation
%   test:           Test indices for cross-validation
%   training:       Training indices for cross-validation
