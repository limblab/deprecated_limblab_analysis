% must be supplied the hold time applicable for the recording.  
% opts should have, at minimum, the field 'version', and a number.  
% As of 09/22/2011, version can be 1 or 2. v2 is the default.  
% v1 requires an additional field, hold_time, to be present.
%
% hitRate2 is (aborts+rewards)/trials since both successfully reached
% the target.  hitRate is just rewards/trials
%
% speedProfile a cell array, each cell contains the speedProfile for 1
% trial.
%
% slidingAccuracy is a moving average of sucesses, with a window size of
% 20.

% be counted as a success (since kinematics are only calculated on the
% first reach of a trial), but also as an abort because the 33 flag is
