function unmerge_spikes(file_path,file_prefix)
% UNMERGE_SPIKES Separate merged spikes (from MERGE_SPIKES).
%   UNMERGE_SPIKES(file_path,file_prefix,file_names) separates a file
%   called <file_prefix>_spikes-s.nev into a list of files using file_names
%   (returned from MERGE_SPIKES). Requires that metatags file is in
%   file_path. Returns a cell array containing one bdf per separated file.
