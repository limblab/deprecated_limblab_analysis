%Get arm positions (normally)
%Maybe I don't have to correct for the elbow??

%Get approximate distances to hand points from elbow
%--based on a few examples I type in

%Get hand markers based on these approximate distances (assignments will be wrong)

%Determine better hand marker distance metrics from elbow

%Get hand markers again
%--Only do it when we have the elbow markers
%--Start a segment when there are at least 3 markers
%--Stop the segment when there is 1 marker (or 0)
%--Do assignments like usual (but w/ extra blue marker)
