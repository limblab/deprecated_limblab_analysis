**Layer Recurrent Neural Network**

Data format
-----------
-I have yet to figure out how to set multiple outputs for the 'layrecnet.' Current hack: train a network for each output.
-Inputs can be correctly formatted by running 'num2cell' on the R-by-N input matrix of R inputs across N time steps. This will output an R-by-N cell array with one number in each cell.
-To format data for a specific network's architecture, run 'preparets' before training the network. This will shift the vectors according to the defined network delay taps.
		[Xs,Xi,Ai,Ts] = preparets(net,X,T);

Network Parameters
------------------
-net.divideFcn = 'divideblock'; % Default is 'dividerand'
-net.divideMode = 'time'; 	% This must be changed to work with the 'divideblock' setting.
For determining network delays, Greg Heath (Mathworks newsgroup) suggests determining input and layer delays based on signals' crosscorrelation and autocorrelation, respectively

Training
--------
net = train(net,Xs,Ts,Xi,Ai);
