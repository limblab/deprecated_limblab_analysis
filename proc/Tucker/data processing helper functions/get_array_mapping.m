function [arr_map, cer_map] = get_array_mapping(filepath)

% GET_ARRAY_MAPPING Generates a matrix of channel numbers which match the 
%       channel numbers outputted by unit_list.m, in the position in which
%       the channels are displayed in Central.
%   [ARR_MAP,CER_MAP] = GET_ARRAY_MAPPING(FILEPATH) returns the 10x10 matrix
%       ARR_MAP through the information from the Blackrock array mapping
%       file *.cmp. Zeros in ARR_MAP indicate that there are no channels in
%       that position. Non-zero elements in ARR_MAP are the channel numbers
%       for each electrode as they are outputted by unit_list.m. CER_MAP
%       returns the 10x10 matrix with the electrode numbers assigned by
%       Blackrock and as they are visible in Central's Spike Panel.
%   Example:
%   [ARR,CERB]=get_array_mapping('\\citadel.physiology.northwestern.edu\limblab\lab_folder\Animal-Miscellany\_Implant Miscellany\Blackrock Array Info\Array Map Files\1025-0597.cmp')
%   returns the array mapping in ARR, and the Blackrock assigned labels in
%   CERB
