function deleteUnsorted(units)
    %deleteUnsorted is a method of the unitData class and should be saved
    %in the @unitData folder
    %
    %unitData.deleteUnsorted deletes all units that are unsorted or
    %invalid, leaving only units with sort codes >0 and <255. If we can
    %figure out a way to analytically test units we should use a real flag
    %instead of the sort code.
