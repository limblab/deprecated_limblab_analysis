function mergeTable(cds,fieldName,mergeData)

    %definition file and other method files

    %mergeTable accepts a field name and a table, and merges the data in
    %the table into the existing field of the cds this is used to merge
    %data from two separate files into a single table in the cds. For
    %instance, LFP data might be collected on 2 arrays using 2 different
    %cerebus systems, and merged into a single LFP field in the cds.
    %
    %mergeTable tries to find the time window where data exists in both
    %cds.(fieldName) and the mergeData and truncates cds.(fieldName) to
    %that range. This may result in a restricted range when compared to the
    %original cds. This may also result in fields of the cds with different
    %ranges
