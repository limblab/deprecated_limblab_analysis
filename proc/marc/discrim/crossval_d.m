function [c, post, V] = crossval(rule, X, k, v)
%CROSSVAL K-fold cross validation.
%   [C, POST] = CROSSVAL(RULE, X, K) returns the leave-one-out
%   cross-validation classification estimates of the observations
%   described by the feature matrix X and the class index vector K
%   given the name of the classifier RULE. RULE must be a string
%   containing the name of a CLASSIFIER object such as one of the
%   descendents of the class 'classifier'. X is an n by p matrix where
%   n is the number of observations and p is the number of
%   variables. K is a length n vector of class indeces in which each
%   element gives the group to which the corresponding row in X
%   belongs. C contains the estimated classificiations in a length n
%   class index vector and POST is a n by g matrix of posterior
%   probabilities.
%
%   [C, POST, V] = CROSSVAL(RULE, X, K, NSETS) where NSETS is a scalar
%   value no more than n perfoms NSETS-fold cross-validation with
%   randomly chosen sets of approximately equal size. The return
%   argument V is a vector of indeces indicating the cross-validation
%   group to which each row of X and K were assigned. If NSETS is a
%   vector of indeces, it is used as the cross-validition sets
%   instead. Empty sets are not permitted in NSETS.
%
%   CROSSVAL(RULE, X, K, OPTS) allows optional arguments to be passed
%   in the fields of OPTS. The only field that is used by CROSSVAL is
%   NSETS. Additionally, OPTS is passed to the CLASSIFIER constructor
%   as well as the function CLASSIFY for the appropriate CLASSIFIER
%   class so that options may be assigned to those funcitons as well.
