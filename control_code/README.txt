This code package performs fully Bayesian estimation of parametric tuning curves with various noise models, and contains examples for model comparison and hypothesis testing. It accompanies the paper...

*** USE ***

1. Tuning Curve Estimation

Open the script 'test_tc_sample.m' and run. This script contains code for estimating the parameters of a circular gaussian tuning curve from simulated data (see Fig 2B and Fig 3 in the paper). Code for estimating a cosine tuning curve is commented out (lines 9-12).


2. Model Comparison

The script 'test_tc_hypothesistest' contains code for reproducing Fig 7 from the paper.


3. Additional tuning curve functions and noise models are described in 'tc_sample.m' and the Supplementary Material for the paper.
