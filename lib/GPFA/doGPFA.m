    % NOTES:
    % - Using this figure, we i) compare the performance (i.e,,
    %   predictive ability) of different methods for extracting neural
    %   trajectories, and ii) find the optimal latent dimensionality for
    %   each method.  The optimal dimensionality is that which gives the
    %   lowest prediction error.  For the two-stage methods, the latent
    %   dimensionality and smoothing kernel width must be jointly
    %   optimized, which requires looking at the next figure.
    % - In this particular example, the optimal dimensionality is 5. This
    %   implies that, even though the raw data are evolving in a
    %   53-dimensional space (i.e., there are 53 units), the system
    %   appears to be using only 5 degrees of freedom due to firing rate
    %   correlations across the neural population.
    % - Analogous to Figure 5A in Yu et al., J Neurophysiol, 2009.

    % NOTES:
    % - This figure is used to find the optimal smoothing kernel for the
    %   two-stage methods.  The same smoothing kernel is used for all units.
    % - In this particular example, the optimal standard deviation of a
    %   Gaussian smoothing kernel with FA is 30 ms.
    % - Analogous to Figures 5B and 5C in Yu et al., J Neurophysiol, 2009.
