% GET_WORDS(time_stamp_events)
% 
% Decodes the words of the new (Brian's) behavior system from the 
% events.timeStampEvents variable of the MAD structure.
%
% This function is designed to be placed into the current MAD structure
% creation routines between the point where timeStampEvents is created and
% when it is written into the structure.
%
%   WORDS = GET_WORDS(TIME_STAMP_EVENTS) sets words to the decoded words.
%   
%   WORDS takes the form of a two-column matrix where the first column
%   	contains the time stamp and the second column contains the word
%   
%   TIME_STAMP_EVENTS expects an 8-cell array where each cell contains an
%       Nx1 vector of time stamps.  Each cell represents 1 bit of the word,
%       LSB first (cell 1).  Time stamps are those samples where that
%       particular bit was set to TRUE.

% First, we need to get all of the time stamps where an event happened on
% any channel.
